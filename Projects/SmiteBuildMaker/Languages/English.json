And there is always a price to pay for dealing with her, if you are brave enough – or desperate enough – to seek her out.\\n\\nIt is said that Baba Yaga waits for travellers in her house atop its gnarled chicken legs, behind a fence made of human bones. If you are brave enough to pass through the fence and enter the house you will see her stretched out across the interior, looming over her stove, or reaching out from one corner to another. Or, if you are in the woods late at night, you might see her flying overhead in her mortar and pestle and the hear the thunderous tramp of the chicken-legged house as it pursues its mistress.\\n\\nRegardless, she is an ugly creature with a long nose and cruel, iron teeth, and her eyes gleam with malice. But despite her inherent malevolence, she does not interfere with others without first being approached – or provoked. If you are foolish enough to seek her, she might well punish you for your effrontery before aiding you, or aid you and then tear you to pieces because it amuses her to do so. And sometimes, very rarely, she helps without harm.\\n\\nBut only when it suits her to do so.\\n\\nNow, as the world shudders on its axis and new horrors rise, Baba Yaga stirs in her long isolation.

He’s journeyed across all of Asia, through India, and finally back to Rome, spreading the “Mysteries of the Vine,” a ritual involving incredible amounts of wine to lower inhibitions, freeing one from social constraints, oppression of gender, sexual taboos, and the stresses of life. Quite the successful ritual, if ever there was one.\\n\\nMuch of this ritual seems to have come from Solinus, who is widely known to have vast, secret knowledge and the ability to predict the future, though only while completely drunk. The king Midas, covetous of this knowledge, captured Solinus, endeavoring to extract it by providing the scholar the finest food, drink, and entertainment he could muster. Bacchus finally tracked down his mentor in the court of Midas and discovered him well fed and cared for. Quickly, Midas lied, claiming Solinus had been lost and the king had taken him in. Seeing through the ruse, Bacchus offered the monarch a boon. Midas asked that anything he touched be turned to gold. Without hesitation, Bacchus granted this. He tested his new gift on a twig and stone and found them turned completely to gold. Elated, Midas called a feast, but found his food turned to gold in his hands and his daughter solidified at his touch. Starving and crazed, Midas begged Bacchus to remove the “gift.” Bacchus acquiesced, allowing the greedy king to wash his hands in the Pactolus river. As the golden touch left his hands, the river sands transformed to glittering gold.\\n\\nOf course, the product of continuous overindulgence in alcohol and deviant behavior, Bacchus could simply be insane.","MP5PerLevel":0.4,"MagicProtection":35,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":1.6,"MagicalPower":185,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":7.5,"Mana":200,"ManaPerFive":4.8,"ManaPerLevel":40,"Name":"Bacchus","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Roman","PhysicalPower":0,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"PhysicalProtection":26.6,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3.2,"Pros":"High Crowd Control, High Defense","Roles":"Guardian","Speed":365,"Title":"God of Wine","Type":"Melee, Magical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"8s","cost":"20","description":"Bacchus takes a drink from his jug, healing him and giving him additional Buffs.","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability Type:","value":"Buff"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Drunk-O-Meter:","value":"40%"},{"description":"Protections:","value":"0/15/20/25/30/35"},{"description":"Magical Power:","value":"0/7/14/21/28/35"},{"description":"Duration:","value":"6s"},{"description":"Heal:","value":"0/22/29/36/43/50"}]}},"abilityDescription2":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"14s","cost":"60/65/70/75/80","description":"Bacchus jumps into the air and, not so gracefully, comes slamming to the ground belly first, knocking all enemies into the air and dealing damage.

For a time, their affair remained secret, but that was not to last. Chaac’s brother, the Sun God, discovered them. Without a word, she dutifully returned to her husband and Chaac, realizing what he had done, let her go, but a rift formed between the two brothers that would never heal. In his grief, Chaac drove his axe into the sky, and from the wound tears of regret fell.\\n\\nSince then, Chaac has chosen a life free of pride and selfishness, devoting himself only to mankind. As a reminder of his greatest failing, he continues to cleave the heavens, washing the land in sustaining waters. Thus do crops grow. Thus do the people survive. Thus is the power of Chaac, God of Rain.","MP5PerLevel":0.39,"MagicProtection":32,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":1.6,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":205,"ManaPerFive":4.7,"ManaPerLevel":35,"Name":"Chaac","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Maya","PhysicalPower":39,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.1,"PhysicalProtection":25.2,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3.2,"Pros":"High Sustain","Roles":"Warrior","Speed":375,"Title":"God of Rain","Type":"Melee, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"10s","cost":"50/55/60/65/70","description":"Chaac throws his axe forward, damaging all enemies in a radius around its landing location.

She catches them in her whirlpool and breaks them into flinders, before drawing the pitiful remnants into the depths.\\n\\nOnce a daughter of Poseidon, she had the temerity to aid her father in his perennial feud with his brother, Zeus. At Poseidon’s behest, she used her control over the waters to engulf those lands closest to the sea – including those that belonged to Zeus.\\n\\nThis encroachment so angered the King of Olympus that he captured Charybdis. But such was Zeus’ wrath that he did not settle for mere imprisonment – rather, he transformed Charybdis into her current monstrous form as punishment for her defiance. He then cast her into the waters of a narrow strait, opposite the similarly cursed Scylla, and there chained her to the sea bed.\\n\\nIn the centuries since, Charybdis has taken out her frustrations upon any who dared pass over the swirling waters that hid her now-hideous form. The whirlpools created from her unquenchable thirst either crushed ships, or drove them into the teeth of Scylla. Together, the two terrorized the waters of their imprisoning strait – until, that is, Scylla was freed to bring horror to the lands of the gods. Charybdis was left alone.\\n\\nBut now, the chains that have held her fast since Zeus first cast her down have been broken.

So many legends are there of his achievements they could be spoken for days and yet still more be told. And yet throughout his triumphs, his death loomed constant, foretold and certain.\\n\\nIn his early years, while still bearing the name Sétanta, he was already an impressive individual, catching the attention of King Conchobar with feats of strength and agility. Conchobar invited the boy to a feast hosted by the smith, Culann. Left unchained by mistake, Culann’s fearsome guard dog assailed Sétanta when he arrived. With only his bare hands, the boy defended himself and slew the beast. Ashamed, Sétanta swore to Culann he would personally train a new dog and would guard his home in the interim. Impressed, the druid Cathbad declared Sétanta would now be called the Cú Chulainn, the Hound of Culann.\\n\\nThis was the birth of a hero, but his death was yet bound in prophecy. Cathbad, the same druid that named him, promised a group of boys, “Any that take up arms this day will become legends.” Seeking greatness, Cú Chulainn raced off to find weapons before hearing more. He saw years of victory, of achieving the impossible, of becoming a legend before him.

He is the God of love and desire, flying about on feathery wings, shooting passion-tipped arrows at all the creatures of the earth. When struck with one of his arrows, man and beast alike fall in love with the next thing they see. Without Cupid’s steady aim, there would be no love in this world, which is precisely what happened when Cupid fell in love himself.\\n\\nPsyche was a mortal of astounding beauty, which made Venus venomously jealous. Venus ordered Cupid to sting her with an arrow, then arranged for Psyche to fall in love with a spider. Invisible, Cupid reluctantly went to Psyche as she slept, yet, she woke suddenly and saw right through Cupid’s invisibility. Surprised, Cupid cut himself on his own arrow and fell immediately in love with Psyche.\\n\\nFurious, Venus would not let Cupid marry Psyche, so Cupid stopped shooting arrows, people stopped falling in love and stopped worshipping Venus. Panicked, the Goddess of beauty relented and Cupid went back to work. Psyche was whisked to a secret location. Cupid visited her only at night so she could not see who he was. Fearing him to be a terrible monster, Psyche waited for Cupid to fall asleep and lit a lantern. Surprised at what she found, she accidentally scraped one of Cupid’s arrows and fell in love with him.\\n\\nVenus was displeased and forbade Psyche to see her son, forcing her to complete a series of impossible challenges that Psyche overcame only with mystical help. Finally, Cupid begged Jupiter (Zeus) to intervene. Casually, he declared Psyche and Cupid could be together.

Those burdened with guilt and regret are claimed by Geb and dragged through the earthen crust to the underworld. Hearts free of such heaviness are taught words of power and ascend to the sky.\\n\\nAh, the sky.\\n\\nIt is but the one thing Geb longs for. In his eye, she is glorious sapphire, an unreachable object. But it was not always so. Once, the earth and sky were as one, Geb and Nut, Goddess of the Sky, locked in a lover’s embrace. Ra deemed their union unfit and sent Shu, God of Wind, between them. In his rage, Geb thundered and broke the earth, but for naught, Nut was now forever out of reach.\\n\\nThough his desire has not weathered with the ages, Geb has rested peacefully for time immemorial, nurturing Mankind through bountiful harvest and stable ground for pyramids and palaces. It is the clash of Gods upon his surface that stirs him. He has risen to war, though his motives are unclear. Does he fight to prevent the destruction of his realm, or will he seize the chance to shatter the wind and reunite the earth and sky? Whatever the outcome, the earth will always remain.","MP5PerLevel":0.4,"MagicProtection":35,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":1.6,"MagicalPower":190,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":7.5,"Mana":190,"ManaPerFive":4.6,"ManaPerLevel":34,"Name":"Geb","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Egyptian","PhysicalPower":0,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"PhysicalProtection":26.6,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3.2,"Pros":"High Crowd Control, High Defense","Roles":"Guardian","Speed":360,"Title":"God of Earth","Type":"Melee, Magical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"14/13/12/11/10s","cost":"50/55/60/65/70","description":"Geb turns into a mass of rolling earth, damaging and Slowing enemies he encounters, stopping at the first god he hits.

Or so the tales claim.\\n\\nWhat is known is this – two thirds divine and one third mortal, it has ever been Gilgamesh’s desire to be a true god, and that desire has often led him down the wrong path. Though adventurous and brave, he was also a tyrant, imposing his will on his subordinates, until the gods sent the wild man, Enkidu, to teach Gilgamesh the error of his ways.\\n\\nHowever, after a fierce battle, the two demigods became friends. Together, they freed the Cedar Forest from the monstrous Humbaba and slew the Bull of Heaven. They fought monsters and tyrants, and with every victory, Gilgamesh’s renown spread until finally, even the gods took note.\\n\\nBut his deeds, though mighty, were not enough to blind the gods to his overweening pride. Though his friendship with Enkidu had tempered his cruelty, his arrogance was undimmed.\\n\\nAs a consequence, the gods slew Enkidu and Gilgamesh was left alone once more. But with his friend’s death came a new purpose. And so, Gilgamesh set off on his greatest quest – the quest for immortality. He travelled to far lands, and vanished from the sight and knowledge of men.\\n\\nUntil now. Tiamat, the ancient foe of the gods, has returned, and Gilgamesh has returned with her. For if he can unite the pantheons of the world against the dragon queen and defeat her, perhaps the gods will give him what he seeks at last.

As a God, he is a guardian of justice, a hero to the downtrodden, the Saint of War.\\n\\nIn the ancient times of the East, a great war between Three Kingdoms raged. The warlord Liu Bei, and his friends, Zheng Fei, and the mighty Guan Yu swore an oath of brotherhood in a mystical peach garden, vowing to create a new, righteous world. Together, they fought countless battles against the warlords Cao Cao and Sun Quan, and Guan Yu grew famous for his combat prowess and unwavering honor.\\n\\nDuring the war, Cao Cao captured Guan Yu. At the time, Liu Bei’s fate was uncertain, so he agreed to fight for Cao Cao under specific terms, chiefly that he would abandon Cao Cao if ever he learned the whereabouts of his sworn brother. Despite Cao Cao’s gifts and promises of wealth, when Liu Bei resurfaced, Guan Yu immediately went to his side. Years later, Guan Yu again faced Cao Cao on the battlefield as the warlord fled from his defeat at Red Cliffs. Guan Yu cut off Cao Cao’s retreat and obliterated his forces. Cao Cao, however, he spared and released, as a matter of honor.\\n\\nAfter his death, Guan Yu’s spirit remained at a holy shrine, coming to the aid of nearby villagers in need, battling the cruel and selfish. From all over the East, worshipers came to the shrine and burned incense to honor him. Such popularity led to Faith, and thus Guan Yu was raised as a God, deified a few hundred years later.\\n\\nNow, he embodies the virtues he lived by. His statues, wielding a massive guan dao, ward against evil. Red faced to represent loyalty, his likeness is carried by merchants as proof they can be trusted. If their cause is just, he leads armies to victory.

But it is not only his senses which make Heimdallr a superb sentinel.\\n\\nHe also possesses the gift of foresight, allowing him to predict his opponent’s moves before they occur and to sense the approach of inimical forces.

Jealous of the demigod, the king set him to twelve impossible tasks, expecting him to fail at the first, to slay the Nemean Lion and return with its hide.\\n\\nThe Nemean Lion captured women and devoured soldiers. Its fur was so thick no weapon could pierce it, and its claws so sharp, no armor could guard against them. Hercules tracked the lion to its mountain caves and drew it out, firing arrows that shattered against the beast’s impenetrable coat. Agilely, he dodged as the lion leapt to maul him. In the end, Hercules aimed a powerful shot straight into the lion’s roaring maw, a place the powerful fur did not protect, and slew it. Then, using the beasts own claws, he skinned the hide, wearing the mantle proudly as his new armor.\\n\\nEurystheus was aghast upon the hero’s return. Immediately the legend of Hercules began to grow. Eleven more labours the confounded king set against him, but time after time, year after year, Hercules performed what could not be done, earning fame, glory, and the peace he so desperately sought.","MP5PerLevel":0.4,"MagicProtection":32,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":1.6,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":205,"ManaPerFive":4.3,"ManaPerLevel":32,"Name":"Hercules","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Roman","PhysicalPower":39,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2,"PhysicalProtection":25.2,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3.2,"Pros":"High Single Target Damage, High Sustain","Roles":"Warrior","Speed":375,"Title":"Champion of Rome","Type":"Melee, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"12s","cost":"50/55/60/65/70","description":"Hercules delivers a mighty strike, driving all enemies back, damaging and Stunning them.

If such an adage holds true, then surely the heads that seek to wear it must as well. Born of Osiris, and destined to ascend to the throne of the Egyptian Pantheon as its divine ruler, Horus is an entity of great power, whose formidable strength is mirrored by his innate desire for balance and justice.\\n\\nAnd yet, these grand attributes are not what has come to define Horus amongst the divine beings who walk the earth. Rather, it is strife, division and conflict that cling to him like a shadow. A shadow that has taken the form of his uncle, Set.\\n\\nSet stands in opposition to Horus’ ascension to rule, challenging so that he might be the one to take the throne and hold the destiny of their pantheon, lands and mortal worshipers in the palm of his hand. Thus has begun a path of chaos and destruction that has claimed countless lives, including that of venerable Osiris himself. Reeling from the cold-blooded murder of his father by his own uncle, Horus swore an oath to all creation, on pain of his own death, to set right the horrific deeds that had been perpetrated, and restore order, peace and justice to the land.\\n\\nFor Horus, this conflict will see his kingdom restored to its full former glory, first among equals of all the Pantheons in creation, or should he fail, see all he knows and loves cast into darkness, corruption and ruin. He has become inextricably linked with Set, a shining reflection of his uncle’s brooding darkness. Horus knows in his heart that Set will stop at nothing to achieve his aims, and so he must do the same. For the fate of all, he must prevail, no matter the cost.

By turns capricious and determined, Ishtar is loyal only to her own designs...though what those designs might be are never wholly clear, even to her worshippers. \\n\\nWhen the gods first came into being, each was blessed with a domain and responsibilities – all save Ishtar. Incensed by this oversight, Ishtar stole the sacred mes from Enki, lord of the waters, after challenging him to a drinking contest. Infuriated by her impudence, Enki sent legions of monsters to reclaim his power, but all failed. Ishtar defeated them one by one, and earned Enki’s grudging respect in the process. \\n\\nWith her newfound power, Ishtar soon set her sights on fresh challenges and conquests. She claimed the temples of her father, Anu, as her own and destroyed Mount Ebih, considering its natural beauty an affront to her authority. She even escaped from the underworld, and it was she who spoke on mankind’s behalf when Enlil sought to drown humanity in a great deluge. \\n\\nBut perhaps the most well-known tale of Ishtar is how, having taken offense at Gilgamesh’s lack of respect, sent the Bull of Heaven to slay the semi-divine king of Uruk.

Indra was jealously threatened, convinced Brahma would let the good-natured giant usurp him, and magically twisted Kumbhakarna's tongue at the last second. Instead of asking for “Indraasana” (Indra's Seat), he asked for “Nidraasana,” ... to sleep.\\n\\nNow, Kumbhakarna is a dozing behemoth, waking only once every six months. Yet, Ravana is concerned with the growing fervor of the battle between gods and demons, sensing his dominion slipping. Prematurely, he has awoken his brother and pressed him to fight. Though reluctant, as if he knows his brother's stance is unjust, Kumbhakarna fights out of loyalty and a warrior's code.\\n\\nNow, that rumbling you hear, it is not his snores, but Kumbhakarna's mighty roar. Or was that a yawn?","MP5PerLevel":0.42,"MagicProtection":35,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":1.6,"MagicalPower":190,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":7.5,"Mana":200,"ManaPerFive":4.6,"ManaPerLevel":34,"Name":"Kumbhakarna","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Hindu","PhysicalPower":0,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"PhysicalProtection":25.2,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3.5,"Pros":"High Crowd Control, High Defense","Roles":"Guardian","Speed":365,"Title":"The Sleeping Giant","Type":"Melee, Magical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"11s","cost":"60/65/70/75/80","description":"Kumbhakarna sleepily runs forward.

Yet Loki’s most heinous act was in the death of the God of light, Baldr.\\n\\nBaldr’s prophetic dreams showcased his own death. Fearful for her son, Frigg forced all objects of the world to swear never to harm him. All save mistletoe. Cruelly amused, Loki forged a spear from the plant and provided it to Baldr’s brother Hodr. The Gods had a new favorite game, hurling objects at Baldr and laughing as they harmlessly ricocheted. So Hodr threw the spear, but, to everyone’s horror Baldr was impaled. Hel agreed to release Baldr from the underworld if all creatures of the world mourned the God of Light.  And all did, save one crone who refused. So Baldr died.\\n\\nWhen it was discovered the crone was Loki in disguise, the furious Gods bound him in entrails and hung a venomous serpent overhead. Loki’s wife, Sigyn, collected the dripping venom in a bowl, but when she was forced to empty it, Loki was struck, causing such anguish his thrashing would shake the world.\\n\\nBut now Loki is free and already wreaking havoc.

Eldest and wildest of her progeny, he carved the savage path that all other manticores follow. \\n\\nHis name was first recorded in the annals of the Greeks by the historian Ctesias, though it is believed he was known to the Persians as well. King Martichoras has roamed many lands, and laid waste to many peoples in his quest to make himself ruler of his kind; his depredations are legend, even among the gods themselves. \\n\\nHe has earned the respect of his fellow manticores through sheer strength and power – those being the only virtues manticores insist on. It is even claimed by some among them that Martichoras has battled the gods...and emerged victorious. \\n\\nWhatever the truth to these claims, Martichoras’ power is undeniable. He dominates all who cross his path; and those he doesn’t dominate, he devours. He has prowled the jungles of the south for centuries, eating anyone unlucky enough to cross his path. Those who’ve managed to escape his jaws speak of his speed and cunning; and of the relentlessness of his pursuit. \\n\\nBut despite his power, Martichoras has been, of late, content to remain in his jungle – until now. Some say he has emerged seeking revenge against the gods for their slaughter of his followers. Others believe he has merely grown tired of hunting humans and desires new sport – namely the gods. Still others insist that Martichoras has decided that the time has come to once more extend the limits of his dominion. \\n\\nWhatever the reason, Martichoras is now on the hunt – and whoever he has set his sights on had best beware...","MP5PerLevel":0.4,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":1.6,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":240,"ManaPerFive":4.5,"ManaPerLevel":38,"Name":"Martichoras","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Greek","PhysicalPower":33,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.6,"PhysicalProtection":22.4,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3.3,"Pros":"Medium Single Target Damage, Medium Area Damage","Roles":"Hunter","Speed":365,"Title":"The Manticore King","Type":"Ranged, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"14s","cost":"60/65/70/75/80","description":"Martichoras fires hundreds of venomous spikes from his wings, creating a circular rain of spikes that deals damage as it rolls forward.

And it was Maui who brought the secret of fire to his chosen peoples, so that their burden might be eased.

A collector of secrets and ancient lore, Merlin is a master of arcane wizardry, able to wield a myriad of elements and harness them to his will. He also devoted his mind to the art of prophesy, one day foreseeing the rise of a ruler destined to stand above all others, and unite the land beneath his banner.\\n\\nWhen Uther Pendragon fell in battle against the barbarous hordes of the invading Saxons, Merlin swore an oath of fealty to his successor, Arthur. From that day, the mage never left the wielder of legendary Excalibur’s side, a tireless advisor, fellow warrior, and friend. Together they brought about the rise of Camelot, and the unity of a once fractured land. The foul Saxons were driven back across the distant sea, and the people of the kingdom knew peace, justice and prosperity.\\n\\nTo any who think to cross Merlin, beware.

The dark enchantress of ill repute was not always so, and her story matured in the great kingdom of Camelot itself.\\n\\nMorgan Le Fay roamed the courts of Camelot inspiring awe and drawing many a knight’s gaze in her direction. In the libraries, she was found tutoring under the master wizard, Merlin. It was in those dusty halls, filled with arcane grimoires, tomes and parchments littered with enchantments, that she learned to hone in on her talents as a sorceress, revealing new avenues of power that were previously hidden.\\n\\nKing Arthur and Morgan Le Fay grew closer over their time together in Camelot, frequently seen hand-in-hand at the royal dances, side-by-side in the war room discussing strategies and plans of attack. There was another, however, that did not enjoy how close the two were getting.\\n\\nQueen Guinevere lurked those same hallways, quiet and frustrated to be seemingly left behind and forgotten. In those moments alone that she still maintained with the King, she sowed seeds of distrust in Arthur’s mind and from Arthur in turn to Merlin.\\n\\nThe schemes were brought to fruition after a heated exchange took place between Morgan Le Fay, King Arthur and Merlin. Angered at being shamed for trivial reasons in full view of his loyal subjects, Arthur used the arsenal of thoughts provided by the Queen and brandished them as a weapon against Morgan Le Fay.

China was invaded and a man from every family was called to serve in the army. But her father was old and her brother a child, and so for love’s sake, she set aside her loom and went to war in their place. She disguised herself as a young man, and no one was the wiser, for her father had trained her in the ways of the bow and the blade, making her the equal of any man in the army.\\n\\nFor twelve years, she maintained the pretence. She fought well against the enemies of China, attaining rank and the loyalty of her fellow soldiers. She led men into battle more than once, setting herself where the fighting was thickest so that those who followed her might see her and take heart. At the end of that twelve years, she was offered a high rank, but turned it down. Instead, having grown tired of war, she asked only that she might return home to her family.

What must it be like to live forever in the shadow of your brother? To be denied again and again that which you desire, despite the power of the wrathful seas at your command? So Poseidon broods on his throne at the ocean floor.\\n\\nAs a child, Poseidon and his brother, Hades, were consumed by their father, Cronus. Powerless to escape, it was left to mighty Zeus to free them and slay their patron. Together, they defeated the last of the Titans and ushered in a new age of dominance for Olympian Gods, but their freedom, their very lives, Zeus would never let either brother forget were owed to him. Even as the heavens, the underworld, and the seas were divided among them, Zeus positioned himself as king of all, and what was Poseidon to do but be thankful he had been spared a fate in his father’s belly? So he retired to his new realm and began the pursuit of gathering worshipers.\\n\\nSoon rose a great ocean front city of mankind, and Poseidon presented himself as their God, but another had already come, Athena, Zeus’ daughter. A competition was held – each God would offer a gift and the people would select their sponsor. Confident, Poseidon drove his Trident, a trophy from the battle against the Titans, into the ground and a limitless spring emerged, but the people found the water salty and undrinkable. Athena extended her hand and a graceful olive tree rose from the earth. Wood, food, and oil, all from one gift. The people decided and the city was called Athens.\\n\\nIt may be that Poseidon never desired greatness as Zeus did. Had his father never consumed him, had he never been made God of the Sea, had his brother never crowned himself King of the Gods, Poseidon might have lived contentedly, but that chance is gone. Now, with the very tides at his command, an army of sea beasts at his back, and the formidable Kraken at his call, the glowering God of the deep seeks to quench his thirsty rage and plunge all the world in endless, wrathful seas.","MP5PerLevel":0.4,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":1.6,"MagicalPower":175,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":7.5,"Mana":245,"ManaPerFive":4.6,"ManaPerLevel":40,"Name":"Poseidon","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Greek","PhysicalPower":0,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"PhysicalProtection":11.2,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.8,"Pros":"High Area Damage","Roles":"Mage","Speed":360,"Title":"God of the Oceans","Type":"Ranged, Magical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"10s","cost":"60/65/70/75/80","description":"Poseidon summons forth a wave that travels in a line, dealing damage and pushing back all enemies in its path.","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability Type:","value":"Line, Knockback, Damage"},{"description":"Range:","value":"80"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Damage:","value":"100/140/180/220/260 (+70% of your Magical Power)"},{"description":"Tidal Meter:","value":"-15% Tide"}]}},"abilityDescription2":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"15s","cost":"55/60/65/70/75","description":"Poseidon activates his Trident, granting additional Attack Speed, Movement Speed and increases his Basic Attack damage by 25% for 6s.

Some believe that these periodic incursions into Muspell are encouraged by Odin as a test of Surtr’s vigilance, while others claim that the Norse gods hope to keep Surtr weak through constant warfare. Regardless of the reason, he has faced gods in battle many times, and he has tasted many defeats at their hands.\\n\\nOver and over again, Surtr is cast down only to rise again, like a rekindled flame. But with each defeat, the heat of his wrath grows ever stronger...as does his desire to lead his people to war against those who would see them bound to their lands for all eternity. And soon – sooner, perhaps, than the gods realize – Surtr will leave his post at last, and march to the world’s ruin.","MP5PerLevel":0.38,"MagicProtection":32,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":1.6,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":230,"ManaPerFive":4.6,"ManaPerLevel":35,"Name":"Surtr","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Norse","PhysicalPower":39,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.2,"PhysicalProtection":25.2,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3.2,"Pros":"High Single Target Damage","Roles":"Warrior","Speed":375,"Title":"The Fire Giant","Type":"Melee, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"14/13/12/11/10s","cost":"50 ","description":"Surtr sets his sword ablaze gaining Haste while this buff is active.

Acts that sent Amaterasu into shameful hiding.\\n\\nCast low, Susano descended to earth on his way to the Underworld. He carried only his Ten-Span Sword, and regret for his actions. What had his defilements achieved but to envelop the world in darkness? This was his nature, to broil like a storm, to frighten and destroy what stood in his path.\\n\\nBut a storm could also herald life.\\n\\nAt a river side, Susano ventured upon an elderly couple, weeping and cradling their young daughter. Eight children, they’d had once, but now only one remained; seven devoured by the eight-headed serpent. Susano was resolved. To atone for his crimes, to prove his father wrong, to better himself, Susano would slay this beast.\\n\\nEight traps he laid, one for each head of the creature, with eight tubs of aromatic saké as bait. Slithering forward, the Orochi spread its gruesome heads to drink from the trapped tubs. Susano cut the rope. Gates dropped. The heads were imprisoned. One by one, he chopped the eight necks, until only the wriggling tail remained. Sweeping his blade split the reptilian hide, leaving notches in his blade but revealing a brilliant sword inside: the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi.\\n\\nTo his sister, he gave the blade. An act of atonement, but not an apology. His true nature would never change, but his intention could.\\n\\nThough seen on the battlefield of the Gods, Susano’s fight is not truly against those foes, but within himself.

Yet his hammer, Mjolnir is nearly as famous as he is, and Thor will not be parted from it.\\n\\nOdin, the All-Father, bore many children, but none as well known nor as mighty as Thor, who had the strength to move mountains and the power to call lightning from the sky. Despite these incredible gifts, Thor’s enemies were cunning, bloodthirsty, and numerous. The Frost Giants constantly threatened to invade Asgard requiring every ounce of Thor’s near limitless strength just to keep them at bay. Had the tide truly turned, Asgard might have been destroyed, but a simple prank played by the treacherous Loki ended with the creation of Mjolnir, the legendary hammer, and with it, Thor utterly crushed the Frost Giants.\\n\\nSif, Thor’s wife, had hair like rays of sun through a cloudy sky, and Loki, being covetous, secretly sheared it off while she slept. Mad with fury, Thor demanded Loki fix this. So, Loki went to the dwarves of Ivaldi who forged a golden crown that would grow equally golden hair, a spear that never missed its mark, and a ship that would never sink. Proud of his treasures, Loki returned to Thor and the other Gods, gave the crown to Sif, then bragged that no greater items could be forged.\\n\\nThe dwarf Brokk took offense to this and claimed that he and his brother could do better. Loki bet his head they could not. So, Brokk and his brother forged three items, a ring that made a duplicate every nine days, a golden pig that could fly and swim, and the hammer, Mjolnir, with the power to shatter mountains. As each item was forged, Brokk was bitten fiercely by a fly, yet only on the third did he flinch, causing the short handle on the hammer. When they were done, the dwarves took their artifacts before the Gods and decried Loki’s fly disguise. All the Gods agreed that Brokk and his brother had forged greater items. Loki, ever cunning, declared his neck was not part of the bargain, denying them his head.\\n\\nMjolnir went to Thor to battle the Frost Giants. Proud and mighty, Thor beat back the evil horde and continues to defend Asgard to this day. With Mjolnir in hand, Thor is an unstoppable force that even other Gods would do well to avoid.","MP5PerLevel":0.29,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":1.6,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":240,"ManaPerFive":4.4,"ManaPerLevel":38,"Name":"Thor","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Norse","PhysicalPower":39,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.4,"PhysicalProtection":19.6,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3.1,"Pros":"High Single Target Damage, Medium Crowd Control","Roles":"Assassin","Speed":370,"Title":"God of Thunder","Type":"Melee, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"14s","cost":"55/60/65/70/75 ","description":"Thor throws Mjolnir forward, doing damage to all enemies in its path.

The begetter of all life. The mother of creation. When the heavens did not yet exist, nor the earth below, she was there.

Together, they drew up the primeval waters of creation, and from those waters came all things.\\n\\nHer eldest children gave shape to the Heavens and the Earth, and created the younger deities. But these younger gods were treacherous creatures – duplicitous and cunning. They trapped Apsu in his temple, angering Tiamat. She fashioned monstrous children to punish the traitorous gods. Harried from their palaces by Tiamat’s armies, they were forced to seek the protection of Marduk, mightiest of the young gods.\\n\\nMarduk forced the other gods to acknowledge him as their king, and then went to war with Tiamat. After a great battle that rocked the heavens, Marduk managed to defeat Tiamat and cast her back into the cosmic abyss from which she had been born. Locked out of the world she had given birth to, Tiamat returned to her slumber, deaf to the cries of her children as Marduk and the other gods hunted them almost to extinction.\\n\\nBut now the wheel of creation has turned once more, and the primeval waters recede. Tiamat has surfaced from her enforced sleep and risen from the abyss to find the world – her world – much changed. Worse, it is infested with lesser gods. Not those she knew, perhaps, but the same even so. Like all lesser gods, they claim ownership over the Heavens and the Earth – of that which does not belong to them.

His natural talents emerged and he forged wondrous jewels for his adopted mother.\\n\\nSummoned to a gala on Mount Olympus, Thetis wore Vulcan’s glittering gifts, but when Juno discovered Vulcan had made them, she jealously demanded he return to Mount Olympus. Angrily, Vulcan refused. In his stead, he sent a magnificent throne of gold and gems that imprisoned Juno when she sat upon it.\\n\\nFor three days Juno was so entombed, and would have remained so had not Jupiter, Vulcan’s father, interjected. To Vulcan he offered an exchange, Juno’s freedom for the hand of Venus, the most beautiful Goddess of Love. Vulcan agreed.\\n\\nThough his vengeance was served cold, the fire of spite still burns in Vulcan’s chest. Unable to truly forgive, he loses himself at the forge. None of the wondrous chariots, jewelry or weapons he crafts can ever fill the hurt in his heart, but each one is worthy of a God.","MP5PerLevel":0.45,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":1.6,"MagicalPower":170,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":7.5,"Mana":245,"ManaPerFive":4.8,"ManaPerLevel":40,"Name":"Vulcan","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Roman","PhysicalPower":0,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"PhysicalProtection":18.2,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3.2,"Pros":"High Area Damage, Pusher","Roles":"Mage","Speed":360,"Title":"Smith of the Gods","Type":"Ranged, Magical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"8/7.5/7/6.5/6s","cost":"40/45/50/55/60","description":"Vulcan blasts a fireball out of his Forge, pushing him back and dealing damage to all enemies in its path, marking the first god that is hit.
