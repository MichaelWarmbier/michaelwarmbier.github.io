    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <ul>
      <li class="question">What do the buttons with the logos on the top of the page do?</li>
      <li class="answer">&emsp;These are the filters for the DLC. By default, DLC items are shown. Selecting 'Risk of Rain 2' removes them.</li><br>
      <li class="question">Is there an easier way to navigate on mobile?</li>
      <li class="answer">&emsp;Typing a category of item or game element (i.e: 'common' or 'shrines') into the search bar on the top right will filter everything to only items in those categories, and make scrolling much faster.</li><br>
      <li class="question">I found an issue/have further questions/have a problem, how can I contact you?</li>
      <li class="answer">&emsp;You can contact me through my email <a href="mailto:business@michaelwarmbier.com">Business@michaelwarmbier.com</a>. Alternatively, you can find me on my <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelWarmbier?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Twitter.</a></li>
